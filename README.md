### Hi there 👋

The name's Bosire, Wycliffe Bosire. I am a seasoned Data Scientist, with experience in Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision (albeit still relatively new to me). 

Starting out as a Data Analyst, I have become well acquainted with emerging trends in the industry and have grown into Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, leveraging new technologies 
and building projects on the same.

I am a constant learner and you'll always find me looking into new tech and getting to know the basics too.

Lately, I have ventured into Generative AI, and I have been able to build a couple of projects around it in collaboration with a few friends.

PS: Some of my repositories on here are private, so if you need to view them, talk to me nicely 😄. Don't forget to star them too 🌟

#### Proficiency 🤓

Data Analytics: Excel, Python 🐍, Power BI 📊, SQL, Arbutus Analyzer

Machine Learning and AI: Python 🐍, LangChain ⛓️, OpenAI 🤓, Deep Lake 🏬
