### Hey there 👋🏾

The name is **Wycliffe Bosire** — a data scientist, AI builder, and lifelong learner and trainer based in Nairobi, Kenya 🇰🇪.  

With 5+ years of experience in the world of **Data Analytics**, **Machine Learning**, and **Artificial Intelligence**, I have grown from crafting dashboards to leading high-impact AI projects across fintech, telecom, and startups.

### 🔍 A little about me...

I started off in **Data Analytics** — wrangling spreadsheets, writing SQL, and building dashboards in Power BI and Excel. As I explored deeper into **Machine Learning**, I discovered my love for solving problems with data. Fast-forward to today, I'm:

- 🧠 Building and deploying models for **credit scoring**, **risk detection**, **customer intelligence**, and **HR analytics**  
- 🔁 Automating workflows with **MLOps** tools like MLflow, Docker, and Airflow  
- 🤖 Experimenting with **LLMs**, **Generative AI**, and **autonomous agents** using PyTorch, LangChain, and vector databases  
- 🌍 Collaborating on projects and mentoring 20+ upcoming data scientists and engineers

### 🧪 Lately into...

These days you’ll find me deep into **Generative AI**, crafting applications using LLMs, LangChain, and prompt engineering.  
Whether it's building an LLM-powered travel assistant or translating and analyzing sentiment from customer feedback — I'm always building something fun and practical.
